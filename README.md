A Sept 2015 version of the OpenEaagles simulation framework ('OpenEaagles' and
'OpenEaagles3rdParty' directories) is included as well as extension to that
framework ('OpenEaaglesSwarmSims') that enables the modeling of swarm simulations.

The Excel spreadsheet title "UAV_Waypoints.xlsx" generates random swarming UAVs
used in the swarmDemo.
