# SwarmSim

This repository contains the code for a Masters Thesis titled: 
"An OpenEaagles Framework Extension for Hardware-in-the-Loop Swarm Simulation".

A Sept 2015 version of the OpenEaagles simulation framework ('OpenEaagles' and
'OpenEaagles3rdParty' directories) is included as well as extension to that
framework ('OpenEaaglesSwarmSims') that enables the modeling of swarm simulations.

For the latest OpenEaagles source code, see: https://github.com/doughodson, http://www.openeaagles.org/
